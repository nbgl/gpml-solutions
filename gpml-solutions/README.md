My solutions for Rasmussen and Williams’ ‘Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning’.

I'm doing these as an exercise. I do not guarantee correctness, although pull requests that fix errors are welcome.

The book is available for for purchase from book retailers and for download from the [authors' website](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/).
